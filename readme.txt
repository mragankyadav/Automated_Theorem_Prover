Configuration used for all the outputs and results. Operating System Mac OS Sierra (Version 10.12) Processor: 1.4 Ghz Intel Core i5 Memory: 4GB 1600MHz DDR3 Language Used: Python 2.7 
Instructions to run the code: Step 1:?The code file prover.py can be directly run from the terminal using the following command:             			python prover.py
Step 2:  When the code runs, it provides options for the user to select. The user can select the theorem he wants to check and also the resolution strategy he wants to use  by providing integer inputs as asked in instructions   and the output will be displayed. It can be done as shown below:
Ê----All Questions are present in the code file itself.------------And so no separate input file has been added.-------Enter your choices based on the instructions provided below.For Problem 5, Question is also being printed for your ease.############################################################Please select the Question and Method you want to check:Enter '1' for HOWLING HOUND problem.Enter '2' for DRUG DEALER AND CUSTOM OFFICIALS problem.Enter '3' for COYOTE AND ROAD RUNNER problem.Enter '4' for HARMONIA AND GRANDPARENT question-answer problem.Enter '5' for the SELF MADE EXAMPLE.Provide Input->2--------------------------------------------------------------Select the resolution method of your choice:Enter '1' for TWO-POINTER RESOLUTION strategyEnter '2' for UNIT PREFERENCE RESOLUTION strategyProvide Input->2Do you want to Terminate the Program after this ? Enter Y/NProvide Input->NStep 3: You can decide to run the code continuously and check multiple theorems in one time by entering Y/N after selecting problem and solution strategy for every question.
